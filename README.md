# Sparks_Foundation_ML_Task
The primary objective of this project was to predict the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of study hours. This was accomplished using a simple Linear Regression model with just two variables.

Tools and Technologies:

- Language: Python

- IDE: Jupyter Notebook

- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

Steps and Methodology

1. Importing and Analyzing Data

Using pandas, I imported and explored the dataset to understand the relationship between study hours and scores. This initial step was crucial to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis.

2. Visualizing the Data

To visualize the data, I created scatter plots which helped in identifying any visible trends or patterns. This step provided a clear picture of the linear relationship between the number of study hours and the scores obtained.

3. Training the Linear Regression Model

I trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the modelâ€™s performance.

4. Making Predictions and Evaluating Model Performance

After training the model, I used it to make predictions on the test data. Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance was done using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. Visualizing the Regression Line

To visually assess the model's fit, I plotted the regression line against the actual data points. This helped in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Key Insights and Findings

- Model Accuracy: The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting student scores based on study hours.

- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, and R-squared values indicated a good fit and reliable predictions.

- Visualization: The scatter plots and regression line provided clear visual confirmation of the model's performance.

Conclusion

This project has been an enriching experience, showcasing the practical application of Linear Regression in educational analytics. By leveraging data science techniques, I was able to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts student performance based on study hours.
